Main Gameplay:
GUESS CORRECTLY AS MANY WORDS AS YOU CAN UNTIL TIMER REACHES 60 SECONDS
EACH GUESS PROVIDES ADDITIONAL 8 SECONDS (lowest time is 0 seconds)

- Allows for custom category creation, where each category is being stored using Redis.

- Keeping track of high score and number of times category has actually been played (play counts after game is finished i.e. either incorrect guess, time is up or all words guessed)
